"When Doves Cry"

1.  How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)

2.  Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

3.  Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)

4.  Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
